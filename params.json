Usually it is shown in increments of 0.5 stars on the store page, but the average rating can actually be delivered to multiple decimal places.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThe code is very \"quick & dirty\" - the Javascript is sloppy, the CSS is minimal, and the HTML is basic.\r\n\r\nFeel free to polish it up a bit - pull requests are welcome!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
